# Bike-Sharing-Demand
Predicting the total number of bikes rented during each hour with help of information available prior to the rental period.


## The Model is build using Linear Regression Model, and here I discussed the steps I have followed while building model which gives better RMSE value ( this is the value which is used to evaluate how good your model is.)
1. Introducing the bikeshare dataset
    - Reading in the data
    - Visualizing the data
2. Linear regression basics
    - Form of linear regression
    - Building a linear regression model
    - Using the model for prediction
    - Does the scale of the features matter?
3. Working with multiple features
    - Visualizing the more features of data 
    - Adding more features to the model
4. Choosing between models
    - Feature selection
    - Evaluation metrics for regression problems
    - Comparing models with train/test split and RMSE
    - Comparing testing RMSE with null RMSE
5. Creating features
    - Handling categorical features
    - Feature engineering
    - Calculating the RMSE with the new features
6. Advantages/Disadvantages of Linear Regression Model
